# Sounds Out Of Bounds - Re-usable Song Modules

**[Download PDF](https://github.com/domschrei/soundsoutofbounds)**

This songbook was created at the University of Stuttgart and intended to be a successor to previous songbooks *Chor Dump* and *Chor Dump 2* about computer science and IT, which were written by former students.
It contains 20 song texts about IT, computer science and software engineering, also referencing many topics for "end users".
Additionally, *Sounds Out Of Bounds* contains two bonus songs in particular about Stuttgart's computer scientists.
Each song text is based on some popular pop song in terms of melody and phrasing. The lyrics are original content.

Two out of the 20 songs, as well as both of the bonus songs, are written in German; the remaining songs being written in English.
